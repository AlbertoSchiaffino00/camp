## CAMP Concepts And Meta-Programming library

CAMP is a C++ Meta-Programming library which provides HPC compiler compatability
and portability abstractions. This project is a collection of various macros and 
metaprogramming facilities and is part of the RAJA Portability Suite. 
With projects like METAL as a major influence, CAMP focuses on wide compiler 
compatibility across HPC-oriented systems.
