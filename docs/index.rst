The CAMP (Compiler Agnostic MetaProgramming) Library is a C++ Library that provides standard-library-like structures and algorithms that can be portably used on a variety of backend architectures. CAMP is developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This project collects a variety of macros and metaprogramming facilities for C++ projects. It's in the direction of projects like metal (a major influence) but with a focus on wide compiler compatibility across HPC-oriented systems. 

Camp aims to be primarily header-only, with only one small implementation file.
