Device Resources
================

In CAMP, a `resource` is something that can run something on a __device__. 
Devices are things like cuda, openMP, etc. Basically anything that isn't a CPU. 
There are multiple resources that CAMP provides. 

.. WARNING:: Individual resource pages are currently under construction.
